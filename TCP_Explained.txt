Using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) might be a good choice for this project.

Why Use TCP for Swarm Behavior?
Reliability: TCP ensures that data sent from one point (e.g., one rosbot) reaches the destination (another robot or a central coordinator) accurately and in the same order it was sent. This is crucial in swarm behavior, where accurate and reliable sharing of information like location, speed, or sensor data between units is essential for coordinated actions.

Connection-Oriented: TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. This ensures a continuous and dedicated link between devices, which helps in maintaining a steady flow of information necessary for real-time decisions in swarm behavior.

Error Checking and Correction: TCP automatically handles error checking and correction. This means if any data gets corrupted or lost while traveling across the network, TCP detects these issues and retransmits the data, ensuring all information required for decision-making in a swarm is complete and accurate.

Congestion Control: TCP has built-in mechanisms to effectively manage network congestion. In scenarios where multiple robots or devices are communicating simultaneously, TCP helps in regulating the network traffic to avoid loss of data due to overloading the network, thereby maintaining the efficiency of communication in the swarm.

What Happens When Using TCP? (Simple Explanation in SUPER SIMPLE ENGLISH)
Imagine you're talking on a walkie-talkie with someone in a noisy environment, ensuring every message is heard and understood clearly:

Making the Connection: Before any data is sent, the two devices (like robots in a swarm) make a "handshake." This is like saying "Hello, can you hear me?" and the other side responding "Yes, I can hear you!" This handshake ensures that both devices are ready to communicate.

Sending Messages: Once the connection is made, messages (data) can be sent back and forth. Each message sent is like passing a baton in a relay race; the sender makes sure the receiver has grabbed the baton before letting go.

Checking for Errors: As each message is received, the receiver checks if the message is complete and not messed up. If thereâ€™s a problem (like part of the message got lost), the receiver can request the sender to resend the message. This is akin to asking someone to repeat themselves if you didn't hear something correctly.

Keeping the Line Open: The connection remains open, and messages keep flowing back and forth until the conversation is over. This ensures that during a task, the robots continually update each other and make decisions based on the latest information.

Closing the Connection: Once all necessary communications are complete, the connection is neatly closed, similar to saying "Goodbye" at the end of a phone call.
